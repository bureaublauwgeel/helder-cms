## Tools

### Shell tools

Shell tools help to automate certain common actions during development. The available shell tools are:
 
* ```create_migration.sh // creates doctrine migrations``` 
* ```reload_fixtures.sh // reloads the fixtures```
* ```setup_project.sh // default project setup, only run once!```
* ```reload_project.sh // reloads the complete project setup!```

They are located in the ```shell-tools``` folder.

### Gulp toolchain

The gulp tool automates the following processes:
 
* SASS files compilation to css files
* Minify of the CSS files
* JavaScript source files compilation to destination JavaScript file.
* Minifies the JavaScript file
* It copies the default project images needed
* It copies the project icons files needed
* It copies the project fonts files needed

Source files are located in ```src/<KlantNaam>/WebsiteBundle/Resources/``` 

Destination files are located in ```web/frontend/``` (see ```.groundcontrolrc```)

During development you can use ```node_modules/.bin/gulp watch``` compile changes on the fly.

To make a new build, run ```node_modules/.bin/gulp build```. 

You can run this command both from your client system as from within the docker instance. The preferred solution is to run it on the client system because it uses your Mac notification system.
